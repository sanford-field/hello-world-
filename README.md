# hello-world-
example repository for learning git

I am learning to write code to advance a nebulous vision of 'self-improvement', which I am pursuing, despite the intangability of my goals and the uncertainty of my methods.  I do like writing, writing code, and making things better.  

I wish my headache would go away.  

Pretend these are lines of code, I am learning to do commits.  PRETEND.

It is important, what we are doing, here.
